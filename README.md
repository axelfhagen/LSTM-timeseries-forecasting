# LSTM-timeseries-forecasting
Using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNN) to forecast timeseries data in TensorFlow Keras. Python notebook.
Project is part of a competition in the course Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning (AN2DL) at Politecnico di Milano. The students all competed for the lowest forecasting-error on a hidden test set. See AN2DL_homework2.pdf for project report.
